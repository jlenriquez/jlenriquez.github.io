####Project Highlights
- Developed applications that detects differences between images. A master image will serve as the reference point to be matched and compared to identical areas of an image. There are several image processing techniques used to achieve desired result. Application includes (but not limited to): Detection of broken character, dirts, tape marks and other printing defects. Main usage is for industrial automation of quality printing inspection.

- Leveraging threads asynchronously on intensive data processing modules. These results to smooth and freeze-free operation of applications especially on factories that demands quick operations while doing printing jobs simultaneously. During implementation, careful consideration were given to avoid deadlocks by identifying crucial implementations of shared resources and applying "lock" sections. Proper callbacks were also implemented either by "task" based approach or "event" based triggering model.

- Developed an image gallery product for filing and tracking inspected jobs. The product is still available and has been widely sold-out to different printing companies in Japan and international markets. The system leverages "server-client" model where multiple clients are connected to a single server in a factory.
