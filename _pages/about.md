Joel's personal playground of his own exploration, research and learning. "Play" and "Learn" coexists with each other to quench his own hunger and thirst - feeding both of his left (logic) and right (creative) side of his brain. In this IO hub you will find different experiments focused on the following categories:

1. Algorithms - Digesting applicable algorithms
2. Programming languages - C#, Python & Swift
3. Text editors - VIM and Sublime Text
4. Custom keyboards - Programming layers via microcontroller
5. Unix flavored OS - Mac and Linux flavors running on Vagrant
6. Github - Embracing open-source, getting his code tidy and tracked
7. Stackoverflow - Helping and learning to/from the community
8. Vector art - Using Illustrator 
9. More exploration to come!

NOTE: About page is still underconstruction. More information to come.
