<p>To begin developing with AWS via CLI (Command Line Interpreter):</p>

{% highlight bash %}
$ sudo easy_install pip
{% endhighlight %}

<p>Some requirements during installation...</p>
{% highlight bash %}
$ sudo easy_install nose
$ sudo easy_install tornado
{% endhighlight %}

<p>Rerun installation, ignoring already installed packages.</p>
{% highlight bash %}
$ sudo -H pip install awscli --upgrade --ignore-installed six
{% endhighlight %}

<p>Check if we successfully install</p>
{% highlight bash %}
$ aws --version
    aws-cli/1.15.28 Python/2.7.10 Darwin/17.4.0 botocore/1.10.28
{% endhighlight %}

<p>Sign in to your AWS console, and register an access key via Security Credentials. Since my region is located in Tokyo, I chose ap-northeast-1. And response format as json.</p>
{% highlight bash %}
$ aws configure
    AWSAccessKeyId=<Your access key>
    AWSSecretKey=<Your secret key>
    Region=ap-northeast-1
    Format=json
{% endhighlight %}

<p>Test our configuration, we'll receive an empty json formatted response, as we don't have any ec2 instances running yet.</p>
{% highlight bash %}
$ aws ec2 describe-instances
    {
        "Reservations": []
    }
{% endhighlight %}
