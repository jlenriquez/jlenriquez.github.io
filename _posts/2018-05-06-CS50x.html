<p>So I decided to take a refresher course to see what is trending in the introduction of Computer Science. CS50x offers different topics: algorithms, data structures, software engineering and web development.</p>

<p>To complete the course, it is a requirement to submit all problem sets that will be given at the end of each week's lecture. It was distributed for a total of 12-weeks, but pset submission are due until December 31.</p>

<p>It is definitely doable even if you are a busy professional. In my case, I watch lectures in the morning (waking up an hour earlier) or while commuting to office as trains are common transportation here in Japan. It is all about commitment to set aside some few hours to watch the lessons and solve the problem sets. By the way depending on your background and if you have no prior experience with programming, I would suggest to watch the supplemental videos termed as "shorts" which would add extra hour. Each problem set too, as you move forward may require spending at max of 20-hours, some are really easy which would only require 1-2 hour to solve.</p>

<p>Using the edX as the platform to learn online, there are also an option to get verified and get certificate, which in my case I applied for verification and after submitting my last pset on December 30, 2017, three-weeks later I got my verified certificate.</p>
